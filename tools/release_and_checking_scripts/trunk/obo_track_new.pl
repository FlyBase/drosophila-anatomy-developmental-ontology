=head2 Summary

Loops through terms from the old file and looks at what has happened to their names and IDs. Gives a chatty output describing their fate, if any.

=head2 Sketch of how it works

=over 1

=item 1. If term is obsolete in old file, check next term.

=item 2. Check if old id is still a primary id.

=item 2.1 If old id is no longer primary, is it an alt_id?

=item 2.1.1 If old id is an alt id, check if old name retained as synonym

=item 2.1.1.1 If old id is alt_id, is it an alt_id for an obsolete term?

=item 2.1.1.1.1 If old id is an alt_id for an obs term are there consider/replace suggestions

=item 2.1.2 If merged, print report on merged term

=item 2.2 If old id is not primary or secondary ID, report ID as lost:

=item 2.3. If old ID is primary, check if term has term been obsoleted

=item 2.3.1 If term has been obsoleted, check if has consider term

=item 2.3.2 If obs, print obs term report

=item 2.4 If old id is not obsolete, has its name changed?

=item 2.4.1 If name changed, has its old name been retained as a synonym?

=item 2.4.2  If name changed, print name change report

# Notes on structure: 
### Bit oddly refactored. Rather than making subroutines, it would probably be better to roll more bespoke data structures at the start and call these during the check and print routine. e.g. could make $new_id_consider{$id}=@consider and $new_id_obstat{$id}=$obstat.  This would speed script up alot too.
