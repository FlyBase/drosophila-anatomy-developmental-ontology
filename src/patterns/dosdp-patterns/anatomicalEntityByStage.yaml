description: "Pattern for creating logical definitions for classes of anatomical entity that can be uniquely defined based on their stage. Due to curation practice of using larval/adult terms for fully-formed entities at the embryonic/pupal stage, take care using this for embryonic/pupal stage terms to avoid autoclassification of larval/adult entities in the late embryo/pupa as embryonic/pupal entities. If a larval/adult term might be used to annotate at the embryonic/pupal stage, the analagous embryonic/pupal entity should use anatomicalEntityWithStage (no equivalentTo axioms)."
