description: "Pattern for segment-specific subclasses of anatomical entities - some more specific patterns exist for certain entities, please check before using this generic one. Parent term should be stage-specific (where applicable and possible) and segment should be non-stage specific (assuming any stage info is in parent term). Stage specific segment (or other segment-specific entity) can be added as SC axioms using stage_segment column."
