# README for OboModel.pm and Gen_EC_def.pm

## Disclaimer

There are much more comprehensive an rigorously structured Perl
modules for working with OBO files available from CPAN:

You should probably consider using these.

I wrote OboModel.pm as a lightweight, fast alternative using nested
  Perl data structures.   Feel free to try it, but use at your own
  risk!
  
Gen\_EC\_def.pm is a script for rolling automated definitions with a
form a bit like OWL Manchester Syntax.
