The Drosophila anatomy ontology is a query-able reference source for information on Drosophila anatomy.  It also provides controlled vocabularies for use in annotation and classification of data related to Drosophila anatomy, such as gene expression, phenotypes and images.  It was originally developed by [FlyBase](http://www.flybase.org), who continue to maintain it.  A number of other projects use this ontology for annotation and to drive their query systems, including [Virtual Fly Brain](http://www.virtualflybrain.org) (VFB), [FlyProt](http://www.flyprot.org/) and [RedFly](http://redfly.ccr.buffalo.edu).  Extensive use of synonyms means that, given a suitably sophisticated autocomplete, users can find relevant content by searching with almost any anatomical term they find in the literature.

This ontology is developed in the web ontology language [OWL2](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/).  Its extensive formalisation in OWL can be used to drive sophisticated query systems. This is well illustrated by the query system on [VFB](http://www.virtualflybrain.org).  Direct queries of anatomy on this site can be used to search for neurons by their innervation or fasciculation patterns. For more details please see references 1 and 2 below. For examples of OWL-DL queries, please see our [query guide](https://github.com/FlyBase/drosophila-anatomy-developmental-ontology/wiki/Query-guide).

This ontology is freely available under a [CC BY 4.0](LICENSE) license. Please see our [download guide](https://github.com/mmc46/drosophila-anatomy-developmental-ontology/wiki/Download-guide) for details of the various available versions. Please see our [attributions](https://github.com/mmc46/drosophila-anatomy-developmental-ontology/wiki/Attribution)  page for details of how to acknowledge us for its use.

The Drosophila developmental ontology was previously also maintained in this repository, but has been officially released as a separate project since 25 July 2019 and can now be found [here](https://github.com/FlyBase/drosophila-developmental-ontology).
