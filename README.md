# Welcome to the home of the Drosophila anatomy and development ontologies

This site is a (new) home for releases of the Drosophila anatomy (DAO) and development ontologies, for information about how to make use of them in your work and for a ticket tracking system allowing you to request changes.

__Please note:__ The code for these ontologies is for now still hosted in SF [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/fbcv/code-0/HEAD/tree/). The SF trackers [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/fbcv/tickets/) are not in use anymore, though. Please submit new tickets [here](https://github.com/mmc46/flybase-controlled-vocabulary/issues).

These ontologies are freely available under a [CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license. Please see our [download guide](download_guide) for details of the various available versions of these ontologies. Please see our [attributions](Attribution) page for details of how to acknowledge us for their use.

These ontologies are query-able reference sources for information on Drosophila anatomy and developmental stages.  They also provide controlled vocabularies for use in annotation and classification of data related to Drosophila anatomy, such as gene expression, phenotype and images.  They were originally developed by [FlyBase](http://www.flybase.org), who continue to maintain them and have used them for over 200,000 annotations of phenotypes and expression.  A number of other projects use these ontologies for annotation and to drive their query systems, including [Virtual Fly Brain][http://www.virtualflybrain.org](VFB), [FlyProt](http://www.flyprot.org/) and [RedFly](http://redfly.ccr.buffalo.edu).

Extensive use of synonyms means that, given a suitably sophisticated autocomplete, users can find relevant content by searching with almost any anatomical term they find in the literature.  

These ontologies are developed in the web ontology language [OWL2](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/).  Their extensive formalisation in OWL can be used to drive sophisticated query systems.  This is well illustrated by the query system on [VFB][http://www.virtualflybrain.org].  Direct queries of anatomy on this site can be used to search for neurons by their innervation or fasciculation patterns (e.g. [this query](http://www.virtualflybrain.org/do/ont_bean_list.html?action=synaptic&id=FBbt:00007401) for neurons with synaptic terminals in the antennal lobe).  Queries of annotations on VFB also use an OWL pre-query to find all relevant anatomy terms (e.g. [this query](http://www.virtualflybrain.org/do/gene_list.html?action=geneex&id=FBbt:00003748) finds annotations of expression in all parts of the medulla and in neurons that have some part in the medulla).  For more details please see references 1 and 2 below. For examples of OWL-DL queries of the ontologies, please see our [query guide](query_guide).

## Request changes

__Can't find the term you need? Notice an error?  We want your help!__

We encourage anybody who uses these ontologies, either directly or via the resources that use them, to help improve the them by requesting additions or changes.  Simply fill out a ticket on our [tracker](https://sourceforge.net/p/fbbtdv/tickets/) to request new terms or to report synonyms or references or problems with definitions or relationships.
